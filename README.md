# Individual Programming Project #1

### Description
Implement a RESTful Web Service for your online store.  The product and user data is stored on your company's local servers, and you will provide customers the ability to sign up for accounts, search products and place orders.

### Technologies and Languages needed
1. MySQL - for storing and retrieving data in the to and from your model.
2. Java
   - JDBC - to connect your Data Access Object layer classes to your MySQL database. (See Spring JDBC tutorial
   - Jersey RESTful Web Services framework (https://jersey.github.io/) - standard and portable JAX-RS API 
3. Apache Tomcat - to run your RESTful Web Service
4. Postman (or similar) - to test your REST API implementation

### Assignment
1. GitHub - Clone shared, public repository and create personal, private repository for this project.
2. MySQL set up
   - See { spring tutorial } for database and user set up instructions
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_store
spring.datasource.username=springuser
spring.datasource.password=ThePassword
```
